# ev3-remote

Project built for the course Global Software Product Development at Uppsala University.

This project is used as a remote to control a robot Lego EV3. In order to run the client side, you will need a robot Lego EV3.

To launch the app, run:
        *expo start*

To launch the server, run:
        *python3 src/main.py*
        
To launch the client, run client/client.py in an ev3-dev environment.
        
This is just a prototype and is still under construction.
